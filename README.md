# SQL Practice

[WIP]

This project's main goal is to create an app that lets you practice SQL locally
without worrying about finding a database you might be able to destroy. Ideally,
you can run anything you want against this dataset, even `DROP TABLES` if you
wanted, and there would be a way to restore it. There is no better way to learn
than to practice.

Secondarily, I would like to improve my Go skills and understanding, which
motivated the language choice.


## TODOs

Lots to do...

- [X] select UI library
- [X] very basic server / listener for input
- [X] search for input in the database
- [ ] find open dataset that's OK to download
- [ ] automatic setup, teardown
- [ ] "restore" button
- [ ] multiple datasets option
